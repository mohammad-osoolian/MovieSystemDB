# MovieSystemDB
Implementing a Database for a Movie Archive like site.

this database was implemented in four steps:
### 1- Domain Description
in this step we defined our site and thought about what this site is going to do. Then based on description about site, we defined Entities, attributes of them and relation between them.
### 2- ER Diagram
we designed the ER(entity relatoinship) Diagram for the entities and relations. we used Edraw Max software to design ER Diagram.
### 3- Relational Model
we converted ER Diagram to Relational Model using the algorithms and technics of converting ER Diagram to Relational Model.
### 4- sql code
in this final step we wrote sql code to create tables and constraints of them, make some helpful functions and programs, insert some values to tables and test constraints of tables and create some useful queries for the database
